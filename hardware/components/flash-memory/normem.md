### General products

This series of products is the traditional SPI NOR commonly used in the market
at present, which is fully compatible with other products from other suppliers
and can realize pin-to-pin replacement. In addition, there are low-power
products in the general-purpose series products, which can consume 20%-30%
less power than other competitors' products on the market.

### High-Speed Express NORTM

The high-speed NOR flash memory series products adopt Octa-/Quad-SPI DTR
high-speed interface technology, the reading speed is doubled higher than the
traditional SPI NOR, and is compatible with the traditional SPI NOR, which can
realize product upgrade pin-to-pin replacement of SPI NOR. Combining the
advantages of parallel NOR high speed, low latency and serial NOR fewer pins,
it achieves the fastest code execution and mapping, and also simplifies system
design, reduces system cost and power consumption.
