How to contribute
-----------------

### This is an open project, so you can help, too.

Although I try to collect, organize and share as much information regarding 
different aspects of IP cameras as we can. But sometimes things that seem
obvious to me are not so obvious to you and need to be explained in greater
details. Luckily, anyone having an account on GitHub can make additions and
improvements to this open knowledge base.

### How to contribute.

Sign in into your GitHub account, or [get yourself one][gh-signup] if you don't
have it yet. It's free.

Fork the repository.

Make changes (correct a typo, add another record into a table, or write a new
article) and commit them to your own fork of the repository.

From your repository, create a pull request to the upstream repository.

### Small corrections, typos.

It is even easier to deal with small corrections while using GitHub. Spotted a
typo? Have an idea of a better wording? Noticed a broken link? Just hit this
pencil-looking button and make corrections.
