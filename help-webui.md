### Updating Web UI from Web UI

In some cases, especially if you think something does not work as it should, try
to update Web UI once again, overriding version checking for the second update.
This may be required because we've made some changes to the updating routine,
thus you need to update the routine code with the first update, and then to use
the updated code during the second round of updating.
