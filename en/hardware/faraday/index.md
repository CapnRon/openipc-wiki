#### FA606TE

FA606TE is an ultra-low power 32-bit RISC with the synthesizable and configurable features.
With the equivalent 40-K synthesized gate, this tiny ultra-low power CPU core is specially
designed for those applications that are both power sensitive and cost sensitive, such as 
the general micro controller, SSD controller, industrial controller, bridge controller,
and portable audio/video processor. In the 32-bit tiny core market, FA606TE is one of a few 
cores with the built-in DSP extensions that enhance the DSP computing capabilities.
Moreover, the 5-stage pipeline provides more considerable clock performance than other CPU cores.
The configurable features of FA606TE include the optional Memory Protection Unit (MPU), 
Local Bus Controller (LBC), Instruction Memory (I-RAM) and Data Memory (D-RAM) from 0 KB to 8 MB,
respectively. These distinguish features enable users to customize the their FA606 CPU cores for 
either in the area driven or in the performance optimization or even in both.

With the sophisticating tendency of the application and software, 8-bit and 16-bit MCUs are 
no longer affordable in the demanded performance in the embedded SoC world. The micro processor
is often expected to be a control unit, handling the algorithms, simultaneously, running a
simple Operation System (OS) built in some application software. Due to the requiring voice
to replace the 32-bit RISC with the MCU in the high-end 8-bit/16-bit market from the customers,
the synthesizable and customizable FA606TE is thus designed to maintain the equivalently 
competitive cost and power as the 8-bit/16-bit MCU with higher performance.

FA606TE supports the standard ARM tool chains, such as the ARM ADS, RVDS, and GNU tool chains. 
The ICE logic serves as the debugging interface and communicates with external ICE hardware 
through the ARM compliant JTAG style ICE interface. In addition, Faraday provides the development
platform named i606 TM which is a modularized platform enabling the new design to be plugged 
in for an easy system verification.
