As image is the basis of video processing, high-quality images both boost the video quality
objectively and subjectively. An ISP (abbreviation for Image Signal Processor) is the unit
processing image signals coming from image sensors. To produce a qualified image, an ISP 
should consider eyes' characteristics among other problems.

With years of analysis and research, Ingenic's R&D team of Image understands well not only
the video surveillance industry but pan-video applications as well. Upon such expertise, 
the team self-developed Ingenic's ISP which is called __Tiziano__ and built it into several 
SoC products to meet different requirements for high-quality images. Taking advantage of
AI processors and AI algorithms developed by Ingenic, Tiziano greatly improves image quality.

### Tiziano Features

With video surveillance and pan-video as the target applications, Ingenic has released 
and marketed Tiziano 1.0, Tiziano 2.0 and Tiziano 3.0 with image quality increasing accordingly. 
Moreover, thanks to Ingenicâ€™s wonderful technological strengths of IP design and power control, 
Tiziano is quite competitive in terms of cost and performance.
