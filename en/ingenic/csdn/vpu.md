To bring better visual experiences to customers, video technologies, which covers from
Standard, 4K to 8K, from 2D, 3D, VR to panoramic view, have been greatly advanced in the
last more than twenty years. In the meantime, more video formats, such as MPEG2, REAL 
and the newer H266 and AV1, have been developed. Thus, processing complexity and computing
burden are growing exponentially.

Following closely the international progress of the advanced video standards, Ingenicâ€™s R&D
team of VPU, which has always been concentrated on the area of video coding-decoding, 
self-developed a base of VPU technologies. With consumer and surveillance video applications
as target markets, these technologies incorporated algorithms with delicate hardware design 
to provide lower power and high performance as well as high compression ratio coding-decoding
capacities.

### Helix VPU family

Helix VPU is a video processor family featuring multi-format video coding-decoding, 
which means that it both can decode popular video streams in real time and can code 
video complying with H.264. Since hardware is shared and the architecture is optimized 
via software and hardware co-working, more video formats are supported with less hardware
resources. As a result, the VPU is much more area-efficient and power-efficient.

### Radix VPU family

Radix is a multi-format-video coder-decoder family features 4K. As H.265 is much more complex
and the computing requirement for 4K is much larger, the architecture has been upgraded. 
To reduce the complexity, measures, such as pre-analyzing, optimizing the key routes both
in algorithm and hardware, and delicate gating, are taken to ensure overall performance, 
area-efficiency and power-efficiency to maintain a leading position in the SoC industry.
