With Deep Learning breaking through in recent years, Artificial Intelligence has 
witnessed a rapid growth. AI, which is serving as a general computing technology 
and which is integrating with every walk of life, is building up yet another industrial
revolution in the world.

To catch up with the technological development and industrial progress, armed with 
its well-established microprocessor developing expertise, Ingenic self-developed 
an AI Engine (AIE) and an AI development platform called Magik. An AI technological
system of Ingenicâ€™s characteristics has taken shape.

### Ingenic AIE

Ingenic AIE is good at computing efficiency as well as flexibility, which means 
it's much programmable with the high computing capacity. This flexibility ensures
that the AIE works well with various and developing neural network architectures,
while low-bit quantization technologies further boost the AI computing capacity of
Ingenic AIE which features low power and low bandwidth.

To better match mainstream deep neural networks, Ingenic AIE core incorporated 
instructions with different dimension and intensity. While being flexible, the
AIE core can be programmed to accelerate the convolution, pooling and other computing.

Ingenic AIE core supports low-bit quantization, thus different computing capacity
can be provided with different computing resolutions which are needed in different
scenarios.

### Ingenic Magik AIE SDK

Incorporating model training, model converting and optimizing, and model deploying 
and inducing, Magik is an all-in-one open platform for deep neural networks targeting
edge AI applications.

Mainstream model training plugins, model optimizing and converting tool chains and 
induce firmware as well as self-developed algorithms and Model Zoo, which is an application
reference base, are all integrated in the platform which is co-evolving with the AI industry.

With Ingenic Magik AIE SDK, developers can deploy models, which can be built on different
deep learning architecture, into AIE running on Ingenic SoC. While the development resource
can be used more economically, the application products can be released more quickly.
