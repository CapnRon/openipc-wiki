Microbe web interface
---------------------

After installing the firmware, the web interface is available on port 85 of the camera: _http://IP:85_
Default login and password are _admin_ and _12345_, respectively.

### Updating the web interface from the web interface

In some cases, especially if it seems that something is not working, you might 
need to re-install the web interface update by checking the "Install even if
matches the existing version." checkbox.

Double updating of the web interface can be necessary if we've made some changes
to the code of updating procedure per se. In such case, the first update routine
will install the modified code, and the second round will be performed using
that updated code.
